            Severe disease has stroken the world for a period of time. The governments of countries try hard to have citizens vaccinated. They also strongly appeal to their citizens to wear masks in order to protect themselves and others. 

            You have gradually noticed the situation of spreading disease, and you also find out that some regions are severe and some are not.  People tend to get rid of dangerous regions and swarm into safe regions. While they enter the safe region, they still try to grab more supplies they can. 
            
            Watching those raving behavior, you are conscious of making yourself out of threat right now!

            <span style="color: #0D0D0D; font-weight: 500; font-size: 25px;">How to Play</span>
            
            We depart our game design into 2 parts (basic task and advanced task). We will finish the basic part, and the advanced part will be taken as extra mechanism if we are able to finish the project on time.
            In our game, on the ground in the game scene, there will be squares colored in red or green. Red ones represent epidemic areas, and green ones are safe areas. To be cautious, squares will change color with the BGM. Players will use a keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) to control the characters to move. If the player is in green areas, he will need to collect items (masks and vaccines). If the player is in red areas, he will need to leave as soon as possible, and if he doesn‚Äôt do so, the items will be eliminated, and lead to the game‚Äôs ending (game over). Note that NPCs may interfere with you and take your items away. You can knock them out if needed to get experience.
            
            If we have time, we will try to implement the tasks and functions below :
            ‚Ä¢ Social Distance : There will be the infected which will be manipulated by game AI, and players need to get rid of them.
            ‚Ä¢ Backlog : If the infected get into the green area, the area will turn red. 
            ‚Ä¢ If you get infected, the game will not end immediately. If you infect other healthy people, it will be fine again.

            3. Item : Items will be randomly generated in green squares, and players need to interact with them. 
            4. Game AI : The avatars controlled by game AI can infect players, and make the game more intense and difficult.
